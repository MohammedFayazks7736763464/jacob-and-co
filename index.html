From watchmaking to supercars, recently, the two brands have partnered on a multi-year deal to collaborate on special edition Jacob & Co. x Bugatti timepieces.The first result of this collaboration was the Jacob & Co. Twin Turbo Furious and the Epic X Chronograph. Both taking design cues from Bugatti creations. Today, Watchonista takes a closer look at the new Jacob & Co. Bugatti Chiron Tourbillon.The world of watchmaking is no stranger to motorsports; in fact, more than a few brands produce supercars for your wrist. But it’s Jacob & Co. that does it in the most outlandish ways possible. And with its new creation, Jacob & Co. has managed to transform Bugatti’s iconic Chiron into a horological marvel worthy of discovery.

        <h3 class="ee">Jacob & Co. Astronomia Casino</h3>
        <h4 class="lo ">The Jacob & Co. Astronomia Casino, also known as Jacob & Co. Astronomia Gambler, is another unique creation from Jacob & Co., conceived, designed and produced to be another step toward their goal of ruling over the segment of preposterously over-engineered, fun, ultra-high-end watches — because such a thing does exist and has, in fact, existed for years.Whereas the mid-naughties were ruled by Harry Winston Opus watches — widely and rightfully credited as the original source of haute horlogerie creations that defied established limitations in design and functionality — the early teens were all about musical Jaquet Droz pieces, big-brand grand complications with perpetual calendars and chronographs and chiming mechanisms. (Some basic research will lead you to realize how the values of these things from the likes of Audemars Piguet, IWC, A. Lange & Söhne, and others have dropped off a cliff, sometimes down to 25 to 30% of their original retail price.) Why am I saying this? For one, because it was only recently that I came to realize how this was a frequent thing with “grand complications” and not just “one-off” lemons, and second, to show that so many of those who can afford these things are ready to take a blow on their purchases (or even if ready they are not, they are forced to, should they wish to exit a position in one of these watches).

            <h4 class="ol" > Since the early days of Jacob & Co., Jacob Arabo has dreamt about a culminating creation where diamonds and watchmaking would both peak together. In 2016, that intimate calling came to fruition with the release of a skeleton, tourbillon, one-of-one timepiece entirely set with very large diamonds : Billionaire. With a price tag, number of diamonds and design that had never been seen before, the first Billionaire shattered all records, and was followed by several variations.</h4>

It is the first to come on a blue alligator leather strap with its own, separate diamond-set clasp. And it is the first in the series to feature a double flying tourbillon movement.</h4>
